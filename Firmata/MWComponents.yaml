name: Firmata Device
signature: iodevice/firmata
isa: IODevice
description: |
    Interface to a microcontroller that supports the
    `Firmata protocol <https://github.com/firmata/protocol>`_.

    Most `Arduino <https://www.arduino.cc/>`_ boards and compatible devices
    (e.g. `Teensy <http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/>`_) can be configured to support
    the Firmata protocol via the Arduino
    `Firmata library <https://github.com/firmata/arduino>`_.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: serial_port
    example: /dev/cu.usbmodem31
    description: |
        Filesystem path that represents the serial port to which the Firmata
        device is connected.

        If omitted, MWorks looks for a single, connected serial device.  If it
        finds one, it assumes it to be the desired Firmata device and attempts
        to connect.
